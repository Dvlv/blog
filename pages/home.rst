Hello and thanks for visiting my website. Here you will find all sorts of information about programming, python, godot, and linux.

Looking for a book which goes through creating real, useful desktop apps using Python and Tkinter? I've written a free book released under Creative Commons. Check it out here:


`Get Tkinter By Example on Github
<https://github.com/Dvlv/Tkinter-By-Example>`_

I may have more useful things to talk about on the homepage in the future, but for now please carry on to `my blog
<https://www.dvlv.co.uk/blog.html>`_.

**About Javascript and Cookies**

This website should function fine with NoScript and LibreJS. There is only a tiny piece of JS which collapses the nav bar for mobile users.

There is NO tracking, there are NO cookies, there are NO ads. I do not like any of that stuff. 

If you do find anything suspicious, it will be the hosting company (I use shared hosting). Please open an issue at `the github source of this website <https://github.com/Dvlv/blog>`_ and let me know.
