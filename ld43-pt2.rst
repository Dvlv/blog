If you didn't read my previous post on LD43, `check it out here. <https://www.dvlv.co.uk/overtime-ludum-dare-43-post-mortem.html>`_

The Ludum Dare results came in, and I managed to break top 100 in two categories!
There were apparently 506 ranked entries for the Compo.

My results were:

**Overall**: **144** th (3.645 average from 33 ratings)

**Fun**: **291** st (3.129 average from 33 ratings)

**Innovation**: **157** th (3.419 average from 33 ratings)

**Theme**: **55** th (4.113 average from 33 ratings)

**Graphics**: **366** th (2.871 average from 33 ratings)

**Audio**: **365** th (2.306 average from 33 ratings)

**Mood**: **60** th (3.806 average from 33 ratings)



I'm very happy with these results. Now my goal for next time is obvious - I must break top 50 somewhere!


Where I did well - Theme and Mood
=================================

No real surprises there to be honest. The game was based on a sad story, thus had quite a strong mood. The story was also based entirely around the
theme, to the point of literally having the theme as a piece of dialogue in both endings. 

Where I didn't do so well - Graphics and Audio
==============================================

Can't say I'm surprised there either. As mentioned in the previous post, my graphics were hand-drawn onto paper with coloured markers, then "scanned"
in with a phone app. This is probably not to everyone's taste (and I can't really draw as well as I tend to think I can).

Audio was the absolute last thing I added, and I had struggles with getting Audacity to play ball. A few commenters mentioned that some subtle 
background music may have helped, and I completely agree. I wasn't in the mood to tackle a brand new challenge late on submission day, so decided
that no BGM would be better than terrible BGM. 

What next?
==========

Before next time I'm going to try my hand at some music generation. I've had a play with `beepbox <https://beepbox.co>`_ in the past but 
not in very much depth. I plan to have a try at using it to make some unobtrusive background melodies so that my next game will be a bit less
quiet (and perhaps moodier).

Artwork is something I have always struggled with during my attempts to make games. Pixel art is the only sort of computer art I don't entirely
suck at, so perhaps I'll use it for my next game jam. The choice of hand-drawn this time was entirely spontaneous (and I thought it *might* 
give me a bit of a boost for being novelty) yet not successful enough for me to try again.
