:Title: A Super Helpful Decorator For Peewee/Flask Unit Testing

Update
======

As of peewee version 3, the ``test_database`` context manager was removed, and models are instead bound to a new database via a ``bind`` method.

There is a comment by the author of Peewee `over on a github issue <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/issues/1450>`_ providing a new way to achieve this.

I have adapted this to look similar to the decorator I am used to.

.. code-block:: python

    def with_test_db(dbs: tuple):
        def decorator(func):
            @wraps(func)
            def test_db_closure(*args, **kwargs):
                test_db = SqliteExtDatabase(":memory:")
                with test_db.bind_ctx(dbs):
                    test_db.create_tables(dbs)
                    try:
                        func(*args, **kwargs)
                    finally:
                        test_db.drop_tables(dbs)
            return test_db_closure

        return decorator 

Replace the decorator function in the original article with this new one if you are following along with Peewee 3. Everything else will work the same.

=============


When writing unit tests for a Flask/Peewee application, we will inevitably need to mock the database in order to test methods of our model classes.

Playhouse defines a very easy and pythonic way to achieve this - a ``test_database`` context manager. We can just wrap this around our test method to have it use an in-memory database instead of our actual one.

This looks like so:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_model_method():
        test_database = SqliteExtDatabase(":memory:")
        with test_database(test_database, (MyModel,)):
            x = MyModel().some_method()
            assert x == "test"

However, defining our database and using the context manager around every test gets tedious. For this reason I have come up with a decorator which will help to tidy up any code which needs to access the mock database.

For this code snippet, we will need some imports:

    - ``test_database`` - the context manager which handles a testing instance of a peewee database
    - ``wraps`` - for help with creating a decorator
    - ``SqliteExtDatabase`` - for using some later features of SQLite
    - ``JSONField`` - for JSON compatability

.. code-block:: python

    from functools import wraps
    from playhouse.sqlite_ext import JSONField, SqliteExtDatabase
    from playhouse.test_utils import test_database

We will use the ``wraps`` decorator to create a decorator of our own. This will be responsible for creating the test database and wrapping the ``test_database`` context manager around our unit test.

.. code-block:: python

    def with_test_db(dbs):

        def decorator(func):
            @wraps(func)
            def test_db_closure(*args, **kwargs):
                test_db = SqliteExtDatabase(":memory:")
                with test_database(test_db, tuple(dbs), fail_silently=True):
                    func(*args, **kwargs)

            return test_db_closure

        return decorator

Since most of our Python apps run with Postgres, I use the ``SqliteExtDatabase`` to mock JSON storage. If you are not using JSON, feel free to use a regular ``SqliteDatabase``.

With this done and imported, just use it in your unit test files like so:

.. code-block:: python

    @with_test_db((MyModel,))
    def test_model_method():
        x = MyModel().some_method()
        assert x == "test"
