Still making time to read this year. My tastes seem to have drifted over towards fiction - I haven't had much desire to read philsophy, which is what I started out with back in 2021.

Here is just a dump of all of the books I read this year, mostly for my own sake. Perhaps it will be of interest to others, too.
