My work laptop was recently due for an upgrade, and after careful deliberation, I landed on 
a `Thinkpad T490s. <https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/ThinkPad-T490s/p/22TP2TT490S>`_ Compared to my previous 
E570, it was a huge upgrade. The specs are as follows:

- **Size** : 14 Inch
- **Weight** : 1.49 KG
- **CPU** : i7-8665U
- **RAM** : 16 GB DDR4
- **Drive** : 256 GB M.2 SSD

Linux Experience
----------------

Perfect. I am using OpenSuse Leap 15.1 and had absolutely no problems with Wi-fi, Bluetooth or Sleep. I haven't tried to Hibernate, it boots fast enough 
that I can't see any reason to bother. 

I was also given a `Thinkpad Dock 2 <https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/accessories-and-monitors/docking/universal-cable-docks-thunderbolt/Thunderbolt-Dock-Gen-2-US/p/40AN0135US>`_ 
which works fine out-of-the-box with OpenSuse Leap and Plasma 5.

The laptop is powerful enough to handle all of my daily work, and when I'm forced to use PHPStorm it indexes a LOT faster than my old machine.

General thoughts
----------------

The laptop is over 1KG lighter than my previous 15 inch E570, and the screen size difference is barely noticeable. The screen resits glare a 
lot better than previously, making it easy to see even under harsh office lights. 

I haven't typed a *lot* on the keyboard, since I've become a bit of a mechanical keyboard snob, but the few times I have used it have been a 
pleasant experience. I honestly think it's the best laptop keyboard I've used. The keys have a lot of travel and a fairly satisfying click.

A brilliant feature of some newer thinkpads is the "ThinkShutter", which is a small sliding cover over the webcam. Some people at 
my workplace have stickers stuck over their webcams, which looks a bit silly. I don't need to bother, since I can just leave the shutter closed. 
There's even a small red dot on it so you can easily tell that it's shut. 

I haven't had it long enough to do a full "review" of it, and I care more about software than hardware, so that's pretty much the extent of my 
thoughts on the T490s for now. I can say with certainty that I **would** recommend this as a linux-powered work machine for someone who wants a 
light laptop with a great keyboard.
